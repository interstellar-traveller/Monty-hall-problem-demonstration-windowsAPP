# Monty-hall-problem-demonstration-windowsAPP

## General Discription
The previous monty-hall-problem demonstration project was developed with JavaScript and Vue.js, which I am not quite so familiar with.
This preceeding project is thus developed as a operation-logic validation for my monty-hall-problem demonstration app.
I used Python to draft the logics, and used the package "tkinter" to facilitate the GUI development.

## Tips
This project is built on my personal computer, and thus it is compiled on my computer.
There is a possibility of missing essential .dll files that when you download the project to your computer you would not be able to run it.
As the environments vary from computer to computer, it is hard for me to completely solve this problem.
